## 🌟 What Makes My Approach Unique

I don't just analyze biological data—I understand how it's generated. My 8+ years of wet lab experience allows me to critically evaluate data quality, anticipate experimental limitations, and design analyses that reflect biological reality. Combined with project management skills, I can coordinate complex computational projects while maintaining clear communication with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## 🔍 Research Interests

* Cancer genomics and synthetic lethality
* Single-cell RNA-seq analysis and transcriptomics
* Reproducible research practices and pipeline development
* Integration of computational and experimental approaches in molecular biology
* Multi-omics integration and systems biology
* Aging biology and longevity research
* Genomic diversity and variant libraries for underrepresented populations
